# Node TypeScript Template

[![Conventional Commits](https://img.shields.io/badge/Conventional%20Commits-1.0.0-yellow.svg)](https://conventionalcommits.org)

Bootstrap your NodeJS project with all the **TypeScript goodies** and,
opinion ahead, the **best dev tools** in the NodeJS ecosystem. üèãÔ∏è‚Äç

Lightweight and softly opinionated, for a flexible jumpstart. ü§∏‚Äç

This repository has only one commit, so you can always start clean. üõÄ

### Usage

1. Clone this repository locally.
2. `yarn init` to overwrite my infos with yours in _package.json_.
3. Change the remote repository with `git remote remove origin` (or you can delete the _.git_ folder).
4. Have a look at the various config files and see if defaults suit you.
5. Install development dependencies with `yarn`.
6. Make something cool in the _src_ folder. üèÑ‚Äç

###### Docker

If you don't have the urge to containerize, you can remove the Docker related files.
In case you do, `Dockerfile` is suited for production and `docker-compose.yml` for development.

### Clarifications

###### Node version with typescript

Since Node is es2017 compatible in v8.10 and above (<https://node.green/>),
we can safely use `es2017` as a compilation target to avoid async/await polyfill.
